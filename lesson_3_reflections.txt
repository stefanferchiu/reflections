When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Mostly when working on the same project from different computers and/or when multiple persons work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

You can pull whatever you want and whenever you want.
