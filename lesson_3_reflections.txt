When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Mostly when working on the same project from different computers and/or when multiple persons work on the same project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is used when you want to clone a repository from GitHub to GitHub. Clone can be used when you want to copy a repository both from GitHub or from a local address. Branch is used localy to create a new direction (branch).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you go offline and want to do some modifications to the project it is best to have a fresh copy of the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub one can collaborate by manual saving or using other VS programs and either sending the files manually or via online Cloud applications to share the files.
